Transpericus
=================================
"Where's my darn house!"
--------------------------
Transpericus is a mod that [hopefully] adds more than just a transperent block!
By the time I'm done developing this mod, I aim to have the player be able to "Transperify" anything~
As a temporary place-holder, there is currently:
-Transpericus [Transperent block. Nothing special]
-Transpericus Ore [Cool texture, but un-original]
-TNT/Cactus [Transperant, but can be improved(I think)]
